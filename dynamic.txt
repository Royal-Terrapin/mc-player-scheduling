# The current contents of this file are for demonstration purposes only.
# Ideally, this file should be created by Install.sh
# It should be populated by Playerlist-Update.sh, which should also handle any changes to the player list.

# This file is for variable storage and is not intended to be edited manually. 
# The values here are automatically updated by Player-Online-Check.sh each time it runs.
# Edit at your own risk!

# To add/remove players, make your changes in config.txt and then run Playerlist-Update.sh
# To reset all players' time played, run Reset-Status.sh
# To reset just one player, set their variables here to equal zero.
